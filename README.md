🚀 Overview
This project provides a Streamlit-based application to generate 3D bolt models for Abaqus Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The tool allows users to customize bolt dimensions and automatically creates an .inp file for Abaqus simulations. It also includes an interactive 3D visualization of the generated bolt geometry.

🎓 Inspired by
This work is inspired by the Pressure Vessel Model by Ishita Chakraborty, PhD. Her contributions to FEA modeling have been instrumental in shaping this project.

✨ Features
🛠️ Generate customizable bolt models for Abaqus.

📄 Automatically create .inp files for Abaqus simulations.

🌐 Interactive 3D visualization of the bolt using Plotly.

⚙️ Customizable parameters:

Head Diameter

Head Thickness

Shank Diameter

Shank Length

Element Size

💾 Downloadable Abaqus input file directly from the app.
